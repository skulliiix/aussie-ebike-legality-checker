# Velectrix E-Bike Specifications Report

## Complete inventory of Velectrix e-bikes with detailed specifications

I've completed a comprehensive analysis of all 10 e-bike models available on the Velectrix website. Below is a detailed table containing the motor power, throttle availability, and Australian e-bike classification for each model.

## Key findings and Australian e-bike regulations

### Motor specifications across the range

The Velectrix lineup shows a clear pattern in motor power distribution. **Nine of the ten models feature 250W motors**, which represents the standard for electrically power-assisted cycles in Australia. The notable exceptions are the Foldaway model with its 200W motor and the SUV+ model equipped with a 500W motor specifically designed for NSW compliance where regulations permit higher power limits.

All models utilize **Bafang motors**, with configurations varying between rear hub motors (Urban+, Cruiser ST, SUV models) and mid-drive motors (Pulse series, Ascent) depending on the intended use case. Mid-drive motors like the Bafang M410 (80Nm torque) and M510 (95Nm torque) are reserved for adventure and mountain bike models where superior torque distribution enhances climbing capability.

### Throttle availability and pedal assist systems

The research reveals that **only one model includes throttle functionality** - the Foldaway compact folding bike features a twist throttle for effortless acceleration without pedaling. All other nine models operate exclusively on pedal assist systems with 5 levels of assistance, where motor support engages only when the rider pedals and cuts off at 25km/h as required by Australian regulations.

Velectrix does manufacture a thumb throttle accessory (Part Number: VXAUS10879) compatible with the SUV model, but this is explicitly marked as "Not legal for on road use (private property only)" confirming the company's commitment to regulatory compliance.

### Australian e-bike classification breakdown

Under current Australian regulations, e-bikes fall into two primary categories:

**Power-assisted pedal cycles** are limited to 200W maximum motor power and may include throttle functionality. Only the Foldaway model meets these criteria with its 200W motor and twist throttle feature.

**Electrically power-assisted cycles (EPACs)** allow up to 250W continuous rated power nationally (500W in NSW) but require pedal assistance - the motor must cut off when pedaling stops except at walking speeds below 6km/h. Nine Velectrix models fall into this category, including the NSW-specific SUV+ with its 500W motor designed to take advantage of that state's higher power allowance.

### Compliance and legal considerations

All Velectrix e-bikes comply with Australian state and territory regulations and meet the European Standard EN15194. Each model undergoes independent testing and certification, with built-in restrictions preventing modification or tampering. This means all models can be legally ridden on public roads and bike paths where bicycles are permitted, without requiring registration, licensing, or insurance.

The company's strict adherence to the 25km/h speed limit for motor assistance and appropriate power ratings ensures their entire range remains classified as bicycles rather than motor vehicles under Australian law, providing riders with maximum accessibility to cycling infrastructure while maintaining safety standards.
